# the working programmer's guide to working programs

"Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it" - Dijkstra

What if nand2tetris met deepspec? And took the browser to be the OS, built a language with a similar approach Rescript uses, built a quick ide with language server protocol support, used ideas like turnstile for tooling around building out language features, provided interactive theorem proving style programming features, and more. The idea is to to bootstrap a learning environment for Software Verification or Programming Language Foundations in Agda, with everything as simple as possible to demonstrate the concepts, and crucially be able to chain verification using a proof first approach.

* demonstrate the joy in the proof based approach to programming
* demonstrate the impact integrated tooling can have on productivity

The target audience is working programmers so there is no teaching the basics of writing programs. All introduced concepts are fully explained by building working software.

## Inspiration

* nand2tetris
* deepspec 
* sel4
* rescript
* proofs = programs
* ml for the working programmer
* software foundations
* programming language fundamentals in agda
* concrete semantics
* turnstile
