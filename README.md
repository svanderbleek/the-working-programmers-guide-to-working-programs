# the working programmer's guide to working programs

"Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it" - Dijkstra

What if nand2tetris met deepspec? And took the browser to be the OS, built a language with a similar approach Rescript uses, built a quick ide with language server protocol support, etc. The idea is to to bootstrap a learning environment for Software Verification or Programming Language Foundations in Agda, with everything as simple as possible to demonstrate the concepts, and crucially be able to chain verification using a proof first approach.

* demonstrate the joy in the proof based approach to programming
* demonstrate the impact integrated tooling can have on productivity

## Inspiration

* nand2tetris
* rescript
* proofs = programs
* ml for the working programmer
* software foundations
* programming language fundamentals in agda
